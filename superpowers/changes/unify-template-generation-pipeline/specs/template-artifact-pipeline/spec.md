# template-artifact-pipeline Specification

## Purpose

Define a unified architecture for workflow template generation that centralizes workflow definitions, tool capability wiring, transform execution, and artifact synchronization while preserving output fidelity.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Canonical Workflow Manifest

The system SHALL define a canonical workflow manifest as the single source of truth for generated skill and command artifacts.

#### Scenario: Register workflow once

- **WHEN** a workflow (for example `explore`, `ff`, or `onboard`) is added or modified
- **THEN** its canonical definition SHALL be registered once in the workflow manifest
- **AND** skill/command projections SHALL be derived from that manifest
- **AND** duplicate hand-maintained lists SHALL NOT be required

#### Scenario: Required skill metadata

- **WHEN** defining a workflow skill entry in the manifest
- **THEN** it SHALL include required metadata fields (`license`, `compatibility`, and `metadata`)
- **AND** generation SHALL use those values or explicit defaults in a consistent way for all workflows

### Requirement: Tool Profile Registry

The system SHALL define a tool profile registry that captures generation capabilities per tool.

#### Scenario: Resolve tool capabilities

- **WHEN** generating artifacts for a selected tool
- **THEN** the system SHALL resolve a tool profile that declares skill path capability, command adapter linkage, and transform set
- **AND** tools with skills support but no command adapter SHALL be handled explicitly without implicit fallback behavior

#### Scenario: Capability consistency validation

- **WHEN** running validation checks
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect mismatches between configured tools, profile definitions, and registered adapters
- **AND** fail with actionable errors in development/CI

### Requirement: Ordered Transform Pipeline

The system SHALL support ordered artifact transforms with explicit scope and phase semantics.

#### Scenario: Execute pre-adapter and post-adapter transforms

- **WHEN** generating an artifact
- **THEN** matching transforms SHALL execute in deterministic order based on phase and priority
- **AND** `preAdapter` transforms SHALL run before command adapter formatting
- **AND** `postAdapter` transforms SHALL run after adapter formatting

#### Scenario: Apply tool-specific rewrites declaratively

- **WHEN** a tool requires instruction rewrites (for example command reference syntax changes)
- **THEN** those rewrites SHALL be implemented as registered transforms with explicit applicability predicates
- **AND** generation entry points SHALL NOT implement ad-hoc rewrite logic

### Requirement: Shared Artifact Sync Engine

The system SHALL provide a shared artifact sync engine used by all generation entry points.

#### Scenario: Init and update use same engine

- **WHEN** `superpowers init` or `superpowers update` writes skills/commands
- **THEN** both flows SHALL use the same orchestration engine for planning, rendering, validating, and writing artifacts
- **AND** behavior differences SHALL be configuration-driven rather than separate duplicated loops

#### Scenario: Legacy upgrade path reuses engine

- **WHEN** legacy cleanup triggers artifact regeneration
- **THEN** the regeneration path SHALL use the same shared engine
- **AND** generated outputs SHALL follow the same transform and validation rules

### Requirement: Fidelity Guardrails

The system SHALL enforce guardrails that prevent output drift during refactors.

#### Scenario: Projection parity checks

- **WHEN** CI runs template generation tests
- **THEN** it SHALL verify manifest-derived projections remain consistent (workflows, command IDs, skill directories)
- **AND** detect missing exports or missing workflow registration

#### Scenario: Output parity checks

- **WHEN** running parity tests for representative workflow/tool combinations
- **THEN** generated artifacts SHALL remain behaviorally equivalent to approved baselines unless intentionally changed
- **AND** intentional changes SHALL be captured in explicit spec/proposal updates
